# Optical Frameworks

https://youtu.be/vZKitQCwvBg

*Video: Track 'One Session' recorded in industrial SVIT zone in Zlin. All sound you will hear are processed field recordings.*

**Optical Frameworks** was an ambient-drone-dub-field-recording project of mine based on fiddling around with **lo-fi analog** devices at hand such as multi-head tape recorders, DIY hydrophones and contact microphones, blending with processed layers of field-recordings I took during my travels. I had released six albums on the Lithuanian label **ColdTear Records**.
