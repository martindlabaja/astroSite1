Work with enough weight that you can only do three to five reps per round. Thatâ€™s the type of load that triggers metabolic change and real improvement, says Bechtel. High reps at low weight will just make you tired.

For example, you could perform a set of heavy deadlifts immediately followed by hangboarding. The circulating testosterone will act upon the climbing specific muscles of the forearms, resulting in more strength gains were the climbing exercises done in isolation. Science.

1.  Climb Boulder A
2.  _30 second break_
3.  Climb Boulder B
4.  _30 second break_
5.  Climb Boulder C
6.  _30 second break_
7.  Climb Boulder D
8.  _Four minutes break. After the break, you should have recovered to some extent. If you are still completely flat after four minutes, increase the break by a few minutes or choose easier boulders._
9.  Go through this program three more times

## 1. Climb as many and as many different routes as possible (scope)

**Plan two training days a week during the next four to eight weeks. On one day you do the following training in a climbing route:**

Exercise 1  
Choose a route that is two degrees below your level of difficulty. So if we assume a 6a, then we are talking about a 5b route. Choose four routes of this degree, which differ as much as possible (plates, overhang, sloper, ledges, etc.). Now you climb every single route twice in a row, without a break (-> series). Before you go on to the next route, secure your climbing partner or take a 10-minute break. You should climb between six and ten (depending on your fitness and time) such series in one evening.

_Important: Before each training, set a technical focus on which you and your training partner want to focus: clean and active; Keep handles clean the first time and do not pick up more than once; Hang exons out of stretched arms, scramble forward, concentrate actively on breathing, and so on._

---

**In numbers**

1.  Route A twice in a row without a break
2.  _Secure your partner or 10 minutes break_
3.  Route B twice in a row without a break
4.  _Secure your partner or 10 minutes break_
5.  Route C twice in a row without a break
6.  _Secure your partner or 10 minutes break_
7.  Route D twice in a row without a break
8.  And everything again ...

---

**On the second training day of the week, you proceed as follows:**

Exercise 2  
Define a total of four different 10 train boulders in medium difficulty for you, ideally with a buddy. You should be able to climb the Boulder four times with the appropriate break. If you fall off, get back in directly or use extra kicks or a better grip if nothing works.

Climb each boulder so defined four times in a row with two minutes break in between.

---

**In numbers**

1.  Boulder A four times in a row with two minutes break in between (if you do not come up the boulder on 3 or 4, increase the break a bit or use extra kicks)
2.  _Five minutes break. Define during the next boulder_
3.  Boulder B four times in a row with two minutes break in between
4.  _Five minutes break. Define during the next boulder_  
    
5.  Boulder C four times in a row with two minutes break in between
6.  _Five minutes break. Define during the next boulder_  
    
7.  Boulder C four times in a row with two minutes break in between

---

_Important: The boulders should contain as many different grip shapes as possible (ledges, slopers, holes, pliers). Ideally, you will define a boulder with a corresponding grip. Be sure to climb the steeper and harder boulders in the beginning and the 3. or 4. Boulder climbing a flat wall._

## 2. Increase the intensity of the workout (intensity)

**If you have completed the first four to eight weeks with the above training, this will be expanded with the following program over the next four to six weeks. So on the first day of the week you train "circumference" again, as described in chapter 1, on the second day you do the exercise below.**

Your weekly program looks like this:

**Even week**  
Day 1: Circumferential Training Route (Exercise 1), Day 2: Intensity Training with Boulder (Exercise 3)  
**Odd week**  
Day 1: Extensive boulder training (Exercise 2), Day 2: Intensity training with boulder (Exercise 3)

Exercise 3  
Choose four different boulders in medium difficulty again. Climb steep and powerful boulder in the first two series and in the last two series rather flatter and technical boulder.

You climb every boulder once and only take 30 seconds between boulders. If you have climbed all four boulders, you wait four minutes before the fun starts from the front and you have climbed four times each boulder.

1.  Climb Boulder A

3.  Climb Boulder B
4.  _30 second break_

7.  Climb Boulder D
8.  _Four minutes break. After the break, you should have recovered to some extent. If you are still completely flat after four minutes, increase the break by a few minutes or choose easier boulders._
9.  Go through this program three more times

## 3. Time to tackle the 7a project

**The time has come for your 7a project. Again, it is advisable to act strategically. Look for a route that you like firstly, secondly, and third, more or less close, so you can go from time to time.**

At the beginning, the bouldering of the route should be in the center. Remember grip sequences, especially heavy spots, rest positions and try to climb the individual moves with the least possible effort. In a next session, the focus should be on dividing the route into three sections and climbing the individual sections in one go. Between the sections, you hang in the rope and rest for three minutes. In a third phase you try to climb the route in two parts: optimize your resting position, quickly climb paces, try to memorize the route as well as possible to avoid small climbing errors and thus additional effort. In a fourth and final session, the time has come for the passage. I wish you success!
