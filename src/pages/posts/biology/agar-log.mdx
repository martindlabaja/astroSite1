Because I needed some reliable source of DNA for sampling, I had to learn how to control the environment variables for cultures of mushrooms on petri  dishes in my lab.
<br/>
This was a first time success and contamination rate was very low. (1 out of 20 gone bad)
<br/>
I have learned to spot contaminations early, transplant the most rhyzomorphic parts while keeping the sterile protocols.
<br/>
I have also tried different mushrom species and clone directly from the tissue and from dried caps I had collected the spores for later storage.

## MAE Recipe #1

The best recipe that has worked for me so far.

- 10g Agar Agar
- 7.5g Malt (note: if liquid candid, add more)
- 500 ml boiling purified water
<br/>
**notes:** 
- stir between sterilization to disallow sugar to solidify
- sterilization: 20min @ 15psi 

If you have electric cooker like Tesla Cooker, pressure might fluctuate so I go for aprox. 30 min total)
<br/>
**Petri Dish Sterilization:** 30 min @ 15psi 

**Agar Agar Sterilization:** 30 min @ 15psi
