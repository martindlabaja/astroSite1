I love my personal space. I am a programmer by trade but nothing stops me from building my own lab, right?
<br/>
I had to build laminar flow hood (sterile cabinet with HEPA circulation), because those units are really really expensive. You can read more about it in "flow-hood" section.
<br/>
I also had to build a fume hood for chemistry-related stuff, this was easier. (read more in fume-hood)
<br/>

Next I had to buy a pressure cooker, already had a microscope, some chemicals and chemistry equipment.
<br/>
And voila, welcome to my lab!
