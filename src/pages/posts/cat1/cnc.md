[linear rails maintenance:](https://ratrig.dozuki.com/Guide/02.+%5BBeginner%5D+Linear+rail+maintenance+guide+without+disassembly/9?lang=en)

 The most important requirement is that the lubricant must not have an additive. These should not be used for linear rails as the additives can interfere with the precise tolerances which linear rails have. The most common additives are as follows:
    
-   Polytetrafluorethylene (also known as PTFE or teflon)    
-   Graphite    
-   Molybdenum disulfide    
-   Boron nitride

The following equation is used to calculate spindle speed: rpm = sfm ÷ diameter × 3.82, where diameter is the cutting tool diameter or the part diameter on a lathe in inches, and 3.82 is a constant that comes from an algebraic simplifica-tion of the more complex formula: rpm = (sfm × 12) ÷ (diameter × π).

"How many flutes do you need?

Material Considerations. Traditionally, end mills came in either a 2 flute or 4 flute option. The widely accepted rule of thumb was to use **2 flutes for machining aluminum and non-ferrous materials, and 4 flutes for machining steel and harder alloys**.Sep 26, 2017"
