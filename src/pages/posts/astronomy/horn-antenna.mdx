A quick software tool using matplotlib with Python to procedurally design optimal horn antennas for specific frequency, gain, and impedance parameters.
<br/>

Original calculations were done at: https://3g-aerial.biz/en/online-calculations/antenna-calculations/horn-antenna-online-calculator

I have added visualization of parts and a GUI to it.
<br/>

Here you can see the parameters and resulting TOP and SIDE views with the measurements of our ideal final antenna.

Here is also the detail of the SIDE view of the waveguide with probe height and location.

I of course plan to simulate it in Ansys HFSS, but that will come later. For now, I will just make one and test it in the field.
