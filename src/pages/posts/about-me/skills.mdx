# Professional Summary
<br/>
Problem solver, software developer, tool developer, generalist, consultant

Experienced software engineer with a strong background in 3D visualizations, educational tools, mechatronics, and electronics. Passion for astronomy and physics with practical experience in automation, data analysis, and visualization.


<br/>

# Programming and Technical Skills
<br/>
- [ ] Python (9/10) (Matplotlib, Plotly, SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter, Prefect)
- [ ] C++ (6/10) (Optimization functions, OpenGL)
- [ ] JavaScript (8/10)
- [ ] Unreal Engine (10/10), Blueprints, custom engine tools
- [ ] Web Development: Frontend and Backend (modern JS SPA frameworks, full-stack)
- [ ] Database Management: MySQL, SQL, Graph
- [ ] LLM implementation
- [ ] Engineering: Automation, IoT, Mechatronics, Electronics, Control Systems, PID loops
- [ ] Machining: CNC, CAD, Fusion360, Mach3
- [ ] Data Analysis: Time series processing, basic numerical methods, signal analysis and modeling (Fourier, wavelets, spectral, filters, noise filtering)
- [ ] Data Visualization: Static and interactive, web applications, dashboards, control systems
- [ ] Laboratory Work: Genetics, biology, sterile work, cultivation (hobby level)
- [ ] Molecular Simulations and Dynamics: AlphaFold, LAMMPS, NAMD
- [ ] Astrodynamics: Theoretical knowledge of fundamentals and application in numerical methods
- [ ] Radioastronomy: data acquisition and analysis
<br/>

Python is my strongest language. I've utilized it for data viz dashboards and GUI (orchestration workflows) for my other projects, OS automation tasks, image recognition, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and implementing language models. In data science, I've worked with basic physics/ molecular dynamics simulations, numerical solvers, evolutionary algorithms, regressions, frequency analysis FFT, wavelet analysis, etc., mostly using packages like NumPy, pandas, Plotly, SciPy, and NLTK. 
<br/>
I use C++ for optimizing tasks, particularly in relation to game engines or when a components like a integrator or a custom data parser is required to run faster. I typically stay one level up until I need custom plugins or a faster code.

Over the years, I've completed numerous projects involving microcontrollers, both for artistic purposes and for collecting data over extended periods or for self-regulating systems involving communication with databases. I've also constructed a CNC router machine for crafting precise machined parts from wood and light metals, significantly enhancing my ability to build and create a wide variety of projects.
