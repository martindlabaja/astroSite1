# Skills

## programming
- **Python** (8/10)
- **C++** (1/10)
- **SQL** (1/10)
- **JavaScript** (1/10)


**Python** is my strongest in terms of languages. In Python I have done OS automatization tasks, image recognition, natural language processing, sentiment analysis and  language models implementations. In data-science related fields I have worked with basic physics simulations, evolution algorithms, linear regressions, non-linear regressions, frequency analysis FFT, wavelet analysis and so on. Mostly in packages like **NumPy**, **pandas**, **Plotly**, **SciPy**, **NLTK**. I have basic knowledge of **PyTorch** & **TensorFlow**.

**C++** I use rarely when I need to optimize things further, mostly in relation to game engines, or when big custom data parser is needed. I usually stay one level up until I need custom plugin of faster code.

Overall as a programmer, I spend most of my time in Unreal Engine 4/5 environment working as **VR / APP developer**.

## engineering

- **electronics & microcontrollers**
- **CNC**
- **CAD**

I have done many projects involving microcontrollers over the years, both for art purposes, so for collecting data over long time or self-regulating systems involving over air communication with databases.
