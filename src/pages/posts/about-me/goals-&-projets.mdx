As someone who is drawn to creating, making, and exploring, I have always been fascinated by the sciences, particularly physics, cosmology, biology, robotics, and audiovisual art. My background in electronics and the arts has fueled my curiosity and desire to learn more about these subjects, and reading about biology, genetics, chemistry, physics, astronomy, and philosophy has only further piqued my interest.
