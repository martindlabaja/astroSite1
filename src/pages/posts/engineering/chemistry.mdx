This one is simple. I wanted to measure multi-point temp readings from every reaction I make so I can see how cooling works, set alarms for certain temperatures etc. Due to limited time I have not got into  calibration of precise temperature on the inside and then had to move to another lab so it is to be continued.
<br />
I have learned some basic distilation techniques as well during the process so win-win anyway!
