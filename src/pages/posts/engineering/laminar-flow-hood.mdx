A **laminar flow cabinet** or **tissue culture hood** is a carefully enclosed bench designed to prevent contamination of biological samples, semiconductor wafers, or any particle sensitive materials. In a [biosafety cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_cabinet "Biosafety cabinet") version air is drawn through a [HEPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA "HEPA") filter and blown in a very smooth [laminar flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow "Laminar flow") in a narrow vertical curtain, separating the interior of the cabinet from the environment around it. The cabinet is usually made of stainless steel with no gaps or joints where spores might collect.
