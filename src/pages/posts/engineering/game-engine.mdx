 A custom game engine written in C++ and OpenGL! It started because I needed to load PDB (Protein Data Bank) format that can contain hundered thousands atoms that I wanted to try to manipulate in realtime and also missed some simple lightweight rendered for visualizations of larga datasets in general. For example also for gravity simulations.

Unreal Engine or other engines are resource inneficient, also its nice to have my own that I can understand and build from ground up. 
<br />
It is capable of displaying arbirtrary .obj or .fbx 3D data with PBR shaders, supporting a cubemap reflections.

PBR was kinda unncecessary for sure, but at leatst I have learned something.
