**Intro**

One of the most common process in genetics is a PCR, which is shorthand for [polymerase chain reaction](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2347-what-is-pcr)

It is a set of chemical reactions that are giving us possibility to selectively duplicate a specific part of DNA that we extract from living tissue.

For this, we are going to need a device that controls temperature [C°] in time. [t]

Commercially available units are usually pretty expensive, so lets make one based as close on commercial design as possible, because we wont be satisfied with poorly performing device, would not we?

I choose to make my own, because I like making stuff and it’s way way more economical.  
Firstly, I wanted to make myself a quick prototype on breaboards to try how it alll should work and if temperature changes I need to achieve with peltier elements are achievable.)
