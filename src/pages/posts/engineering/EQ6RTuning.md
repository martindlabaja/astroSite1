In my experience you can get a dramatic improvement by: 

1. Remove stiction from both axis through adjustment 
2. Remove backlash on both axis through adjustments 
3. Remove grease from clutch surface and button. 
4. Adjust pressure on the worm gear shaft 
5. Adjust belts to correct tension 


	 Those items which are simple and can be done externally will give you very good tracking. Replacing the bearings IMO is pretty expensive…requires some technical expertise and is kind of in the area of diminishing returns. I’m in the .25 to . 50 tracking range without changing bearings
