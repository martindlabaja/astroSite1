A **fume hood** (sometimes called a **fume cupboard** or **fume closet**) is a type of local [ventilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture) "Ventilation (architecture)") device that is designed to limit exposure to hazardous or toxic fumes, [vapors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor "Vapor") or [dusts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust "Dust"). The device is an enclosure with a movable [sash window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sash_window "Sash window") on one side that traps and exhausts gases and particulates either out of the area (through a [duct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duct_(industrial_exhaust) "Duct (industrial exhaust)")) or back into the room (through [air filtration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_filter "Air filter")), and is most frequently used in [laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory "Laboratory") settings.

# Planning

The biggest issue in design are of course **used** materials as they will dictate range of chemicals we can use inside the fumehood. Acidic chemicals will be highly corrosive so we need to make sure our fans for air outtake will be sealed.

Fortunately chemical resistance properties are well-tested and we can find useful [tables](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=a48dbaf87d89a746&rlz=1C1BYYL_csCZ1083CZ1083&sxsrf=ACQVn0_ihCPE-6el9ogjdkzx1StmpmTSiQ:1707064253086&q=abs+chemical+resistance&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2wafzjZKEAxXcxQIHHSvvD-cQ0pQJegQIDBAB&biw=818&bih=851&dpr=1.56#imgrc=rVRHYNYrTx1yAM) of compatible chemicals on the web.

Mine is made out of laminated wood coated with a liquid fireproof layer and connectors are 3D printed out of **ABS**.

For fans I opted for marine purposed fan used in highly salinated environment and should be completely sealed.

***Photo:** Pre-viz in Blender*

In the pre-viz image you can see two boards called an "**airfoil**" which make use of **Bernoulli's principle**: Within a horizontal flow of fluid, points of higher fluid speed will have less pressure than points of slower fluid speed.

This is useful in as it will create lower pressure area towards the rear of cabinet (because air is forced to move faster there), sucking all the chemical vapors away from cabinet entering.

For this project I did not run any experimental computer fluid simulations and decided to replicate exact dimension from already existing commercially available models.
